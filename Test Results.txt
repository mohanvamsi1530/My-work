In order to examine the test results of present day random generators, National Institute of Standards and Technonolgy has released a paper, which consists of various techiniques to evaluate the degree of randomness.The first technique deals with calculating threshold values, second approach checks if the statistic fall under a specififc calculated range or not, last method invovles in calculating probablistic value to verify its randomness. Among these three we adopted second method i.e., We calculated a range for each test outcome and checked if no.of zero's and one's in the result satisfy that range or not.

"Test Results" excel consists of no. of zeros, no. of one's, Upper range value, Lower range value, and a boolean representing whether that particular test results fall into required range or not. From that we can observe that among 100 test cases, just six values are out of range remaining ninty four values satisfy the range. This proves that our process resulted out truly random values.
